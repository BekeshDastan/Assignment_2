                <p>Elon Musk (1971 – ) is a South African–born entrepreneur, engineer, and inventor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX, and CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. Musk has revolutionized the electric vehicle industry and reusable rocket technology. His vision is to make life multi-planetary and accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</p>
                <p>Before SpaceX and Tesla, Musk co-founded Zip2, one of the first online city guide services, and later X.com, an online payment company that eventually became PayPal. The sale of PayPal gave him the resources to pursue his more ambitious projects in space exploration and sustainable energy. His career reflects a willingness to take risks and invest in industries where others saw only obstacles.</p>
                <p>Beyond his companies, Musk is known for ambitious ideas like the Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system, and Neuralink, which aims to connect the human brain with computers. Despite facing criticism and controversy, his influence on technology and society is undeniable. Musk’s work continues to inspire innovation, entrepreneurship, and bold thinking across the world.</p>
